The *tidyverse* is a collection of R packages designed for **data science**.

Some of the key packages include:

1. **ggplot2**
   - `geom_point()`
2. **dplyr**
   - `filter()`
3. **tidyr**
   - `pivot_longer()`

*tidyverse* packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.[^1]
