# Weekly Check In

# Start Recording

## Today's Agenda
<hr>
- Weekly Check In
- Norms
- Creating R Project for This Class
- Working with R Markdown
- `tidyverse` Fundamentals - Code-a-long
  - What is `ggplot2`?
- `tidykids` Scavenger Hunt
- Looking Ahead

## Norms
<hr>

:::{.compact-font}
| In person norms | And also, for online learning... |
|----------|----------|
| Be fully present to each other & the work. | Keep your video on when possible. In large groups, mute your microphone when not talking. Close/mute/minimize other apps and devices to avoid distraction. |
| Assume positive intent & also take responsibility for the impact you have. | Remember online interaction masks even more of the full story. Notice when you are making assumptions, and seek information to check them. |
| Embrace collaboration. | Use the gallery view so you can see everyone. Use breakout groups as an opportunity to collaborate. |
| Be open to learning and accept non-closure. | Expect the inevitable technical glitches and learning curves. Exercise patience with one another. |
| Be aware of when to step up and step back. When stepping back, do so as an active listener. | Try out different modes of participation. Step back by making space for others to engage in these. |
| Land your plane--get to the point you intended. | We all know how hard it is to be talked at, especially in a Zoom session, so let's keep it to a minimum. |

# R Markdown

## Creating an R Project
- If you haven't already, let's create an R Project for this class.
- I use `Week-1`, `Week-2`, etc. subfolders.

## R Markdown
<hr>

:::{.small-font}
- R Markdown is a file format for making **dynamic documents with R**.
- An R Markdown document is written in markdown (a **plain text** format) and contains **chunks of embedded R code**.
- The markdown file is then **processed by `knitr`**, and then pandoc which converts the markdown to a **PDF, Word, or HTML file**.
- File extension: `.Rmd`
:::

## R Markdown - Plain Text
<hr>

:::{layout="[50,50]"}
![](RmdPlainTextExample.png)<br>[Plain Text in `.Rmd`]{.small-font}

## R Markdown - Plain Text - Activity
<hr>
- In [Canvas](https://utk.instructure.com/courses/213032) you will find an activity called `R Markdown: In-Class Activity`
- It should open up another page with instructions.
- There is file to download in the opening step. Download it and put it in your `Week-2` folder within your R Project.

## R Markdown - Code Chunks
<hr>

- The other part of an R Markdown document is the **code chunks**.

:::{layout="[50,50]"}
![](RMarkdownCodeChunkExample.png)<br>[Code Chunk in a `.Rmd`]{.small-font}

::::{.small-font}
- {r echo = T} : **shows the code** when knitted
- {r eval = F} : **code does not run**
- {r message = F}: **hides messages** 
- {r warning = F}: **hides warnings**
::::

:::

## R Markdown
<hr>
- Most of your homework will be submitted as R Markdown files.
- Including this week's!
