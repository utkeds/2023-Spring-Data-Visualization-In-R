## Norms
<hr>

:::{.compact-font}
| In person norms | And also, for online learning... |
|----------|----------|
| Be fully present to each other & the work. | Keep your video on when possible. In large groups, mute your microphone when not talking. Close/mute/minimize other apps and devices to avoid distraction. |
| Assume positive intent & also take responsibility for the impact you have. | Remember online interaction masks even more of the full story. Notice when you are making assumptions, and seek information to check them. |
| Embrace collaboration. | Use the gallery view so you can see everyone. Use breakout groups as an opportunity to collaborate. |
| Be open to learning and accept non-closure. | Expect the inevitable technical glitches and learning curves. Exercise patience with one another. |
| Be aware of when to step up and step back. When stepping back, do so as an active listener. | Try out different modes of participation. Step back by making space for others to engage in these. |
| Land your plane--get to the point you intended. | We all know how hard it is to be talked at, especially in a Zoom session, so let's keep it to a minimum. |
