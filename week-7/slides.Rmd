.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[college data]

Let's use a new data set: college completion rates (from the NCES)
- U.S News and World Report college rankings (from Reiter)

We will read both in in a new way - copy this code! Please download the `.xlsx` file from the week 6 module

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(readxl) # install.packages("readxl")

rankings <- read_excel("US-News-Rankings-Universities-2020.xlsx")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[rankings]

Let's use `rankings`` to generate histograms and points

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rankings
```
