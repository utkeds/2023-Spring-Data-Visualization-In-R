# Today's Class

For today's class, we are going to do something different.

We are going to meet in gather.town to become familiar with the environment we will use for our final presentations.

---

# gather.town

gather.town is an 8-bit virtual communication environment. It is like Zoom with the ability to navigate in and out of different conversations with different people - all in an interactive environment.

# gather.town

In gather.town, distance determines if you can communicate with another invidividual.

# What is this?

.pull-left[

<img src="joydivisionplot.jpg" height="400px"/>

]

.pull-right[
- This is the cover to Joy Division's 1979 album *Unknown Pleasures*
- The plot depicts the radio emissions of a rotating neutron star.
- Each line is a pulse given when it turns
- Together, it is a **distribution** of emissions from different pulses
- This visualization - or the album cover - has reached iconic status and can often be seen on clothing

# Histograms and other distributions

What do you think the following graphs show?

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
hist(penguins$body_mass_g)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
boxplot(penguins$body_mass_g)
```

]
---
# Histograms and other distributions

Wait...where is `ggplot`?

<!-- Students may not have seen some of base R's plot functions. Now is a good chance to introduce these two and what the $ means.

Reference: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html
-->

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
hist(penguins$body_mass_g)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
boxplot(penguins$body_mass_g)
```

]

---
# Histograms and other distributions

You can easily split out the plot with `fill`

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, fill=species))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200, position = "identity", alpha=.6)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y=body_mass_g, fill=species))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

]

---
.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

]

# Density and Ridgeline Plots

Sometimes you want to know the shape of your distribution, but you do not want a histogram.

```{r, fig.height=2}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
  geom_density()
```

Note:
Plotting a histogram and density curve together takes a bit more work:


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=2}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
geom_histogram(binwidth=100, colour="black", 
               aes(y=..density..))+
stat_function(fun=dnorm,
                         color="red",
                         args=list(mean=mean(penguins$body_mass_g,
                                             na.rm=TRUE), 
                                   sd=sd(penguins$body_mass_g,
                                         na.rm=TRUE)))

```

---
# Ridgeline Plots

We can easily get a bit fancier with the `ggridges` package:

```{r, fig.height=5}
library(ggridges)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=island))+
  geom_density_ridges()
```

---
# Ridgeline Plots

How can ridgeline plots be useful?

.pull-left[

Imagine a **long** dataset like this:

```{r}
penguins_long <- penguins %>%
  rownames_to_column("id") %>%
  pivot_longer(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g,
               names_to="stat_type", values_to="stat")

head(penguins_long, n=10)
```


]

We can easily see a certain variable is not distributed the same.

**Why do you think this is?**

.pull_right[
```{r, fig.height=4}
ggplot(penguins_long, aes(x=stat, y=stat_type))+
  geom_density_ridges()
```

]

# Activity - Pilot and Navigator

You will work in small groups (breakout rooms) where one student is a pilot and the other students are navigators:

- The **pilot** will share their screen and type the code
- The **navigators** will tell the pilot what to type (the pilot can help, too)

Access the Week 13 Distributions Activity.Rmd document.
