This week's assignment is quite simple. You are going to re-ruse some of your old graphs and create psuedo-infographics in order to practice making small multiples and compound graphics.



## Small Multiples

Using a previous data set (and analysis), develop a data visualization that uses small multiples. To add a little pizazz and style your facets, consult these resources:

- https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/how-to-change-ggplot-facet-labels/





## Compound Plots

Using a previous data set and related analyses and/or visualizations, combine separate plots using `patchwork`. If you need additional help, please check out its documentation: https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/index.html
