This week's assignment is quite simple. You are going to re-ruse some of your old graphs in order to practice making compound graphics and small multiples and using annotations.



## Small Multiples

Using a previous data set (and analysis), develop a data visualization that uses small multiples. To add a little pizazz and style your facets, consider consulting these resources:

- http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Facets_(ggplot2)/
- https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/how-to-change-ggplot-facet-labels/





## Compound Plots

Using a previous data set and related analyses and/or visualizations, combine separate plots using `patchwork`. For some additional functionality (or examples), check out its documentation: https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/index.html






## Annotations

Again using a previous data set and related analyses and/or visualizations add two or more annotation layers to a plot.
