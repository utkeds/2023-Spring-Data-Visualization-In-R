# Key concept #1: Histograms

# Histograms and other distributions

What do you think the following graphs show?

.pull-left[

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

```{r, fig.height=5}
hist(penguins$body_mass_g)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
boxplot(penguins$body_mass_g)
```

# The classics

Wait...where is `ggplot`?

<!-- Students may not have seen some of base R's plot functions. Now is a good chance to introduce these two and what the $ means.

Reference: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html
-->

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
hist(penguins$body_mass_g)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
boxplot(penguins$body_mass_g)
```

]

---

# The classics

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

]


---

# A (relative) newcomer

```{r, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
  geom_density()
```

---

# Histograms vs. Density plots

.pull-left[

### Histograms

- How it works: *bin* and count observations
- Key consideration: How many bins (defaults are often but not always suitable)
- Historically important, but somewhat replaced by newer techniques

]

.pull-right[

### Density plots

- How it works: uses fancy math to _estimate_ a curve that represents the distribution of the data
- Key consideration: avoiding representing made-up data points
- Can be a little hard to straightforwardly interpret

]

---

# Multiple distributions: Histograms and box plots

You can easily split out the plot with `fill`

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, fill=species))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200, position = "identity", alpha=.6)
```


]

.pull-right[

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y=body_mass_g, fill=species))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

]

---

# Multiple plots; Overlapping densities

*set alpha*

```{r, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, fill=species))+
  geom_density(alpha = .25)
```

---

# Multiple plots; Violin plots

```{r, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_violin()
```

---

# Density and Ridgeline Plots

Sometimes you want to know the shape of your distribution, but you do not want a histogram.

```{r, fig.height=2}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
  geom_density()
```

Note:
Plotting a histogram and density curve together takes a bit more work:


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=2}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g))+
geom_histogram(binwidth=100, colour="black", 
               aes(y=..density..))+
stat_function(fun=dnorm,
                         color="red",
                         args=list(mean=mean(penguins$body_mass_g,
                                             na.rm=TRUE), 
                                   sd=sd(penguins$body_mass_g,
                                         na.rm=TRUE)))

```

---
# Ridgeline Plots

We can easily get a bit fancier with the `ggridges` package:

```{r, fig.height=5}
library(ggridges)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=island))+
  geom_density_ridges()
```

---
# Ridgeline Plots

How can ridgeline plots be useful?

.pull-left[

Imagine a **long** dataset like this:

```{r}
penguins_long <- penguins %>%
  rownames_to_column("id") %>%
  pivot_longer(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g,
               names_to="stat_type", values_to="stat")

head(penguins_long, n=5)
```

]

.pull_right[

```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(penguins_long, aes(x=stat, y=stat_type))+
  geom_density_ridges()
```

# Key concept #2: Scatterplots

Scatterplots are quite simple to create in R. For today's examples, we will use the `palmerpenguin` package and its `penguins` data set, which contains measurements for different penguins in Antarctica.

<img src='https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/lter_penguins.png' height=400px />

```{r include=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

# Key concept #3

- When to use columns - amounts (and possibly proportions)
- When to use points - x and y, or time, or certain amounts
- When to use distributions - to visualize spread
- What are some other core chart types? Lines and smoothed lines

???

Reflection: I don’t understand the difference between geom_bar() and geom_col(). I would like to better understand the arguments for the different geom functions and when you need things in certain orders as you build out your plot/why they need to be in the particular order. For example, I’ve noticed it matters where you put your theme vs theme for text orientation. I care about this one in particular as I prefer to rotate my axis labels over altering the graph orientation in my own figures.

---

First, we can use base R to simply plot all the data in a *scatterplot matrix*

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
plot(penguins)
```

This is not super useful, however.

---
# Scatterplots in R

We can make a bivariate (two-variable) scatterplot using `geom_point()`.


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_point()
```

---

# Scatterplots in R

We can change the color of all dots simply with `color = `


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_point(color="skyblue")
```

---

# Scatterplots in R

We can map the color to the penguin species by using `color` inside of `aes`


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g,
             color=species))+
  geom_point()
```

---
# Scatterplots in R

We can also map the *shape* to a variable using `shape`


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=sex))+
  geom_point()
```

---
# Scatterplots in R

We can separate this out by island using `facet_wrap`. This allows us to see very  clear relationships between flipper length and body mass.


```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=sex))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~island, nrow=1)
```

---
# Scatterplots in R

All of the colors and shapes can be controlled using `scale_color_manual` and `scale_shape_manual`. See list of shapes [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html#polygons).

.pull-left[

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "darkorange",
                                "Chinstrap" = 
  "purple","Gentoo" = "cyan4")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Adelie" = 17,"Chinstrap" = 19,
                                "Gentoo" = 18))
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "darkorange",
                                "Chinstrap" = 
  "purple","Gentoo" = "cyan4")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Adelie" = 17,
                                "Chinstrap" = 19,
                                "Gentoo" = 18))
```

]

# Scatterplots in R


.pull-left[

Scatterplots often are useful for **correlations**. It is possible to display not only the correlation but the slope of a line for each scatterplot. We can add the correlation coefficient with `ggpubr::stat_cor()` and the regression line with `geom_smooth()`

```{r include=FALSE}
library(ggpubr)
```


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,alpha = 0.8) +
  stat_cor()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "darkorange",
                                "Chinstrap" = 
  "purple","Gentoo" = "cyan4")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Adelie" = 17,"Chinstrap" = 19,
                                "Gentoo" = 18))
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,
             color=species, shape=species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,alpha = 0.8) +
  stat_cor()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "darkorange",
                                "Chinstrap" = 
  "purple","Gentoo" = "cyan4")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Adelie" = 17,"Chinstrap" = 19,
                                "Gentoo" = 18))
```

# Code-along


.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[college data]

Let's use two new data sets, both related to colleges: 

- college completion rates (from the NCES)
- U.S News and World Report college rankings (from Reiter)

We will read both in in a new way - copy this code!

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

]

.panel[.panel-name[college completion]

Let's use `college_completion` to generate plots with points and lines

```{r, eval = FALSE}
college_completion
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[rankings]

Let's use `rankings`` to generate histograms

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rankins
```
