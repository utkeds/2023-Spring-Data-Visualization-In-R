## Norms
<hr>

:::{.compact-font}
| In person norms | And also, for online learning... |
|----------|----------|
| Be fully present to each other & the work. | Keep your video on when possible. In large groups, mute your microphone when not talking. Close/mute/minimize other apps and devices to avoid distraction. |
| Assume positive intent & also take responsibility for the impact you have. | Remember online interaction masks even more of the full story. Notice when you are making assumptions, and seek information to check them. |
| Embrace collaboration. | Use the gallery view so you can see everyone. Use breakout groups as an opportunity to collaborate. |
| Be open to learning and accept non-closure. | Expect the inevitable technical glitches and learning curves. Exercise patience with one another. |
| Be aware of when to step up and step back. When stepping back, do so as an active listener. | Try out different modes of participation. Step back by making space for others to engage in these. |
| Land your plane--get to the point you intended. | We all know how hard it is to be talked at, especially in a Zoom session, so let's keep it to a minimum. |

## Tables in R{.smaller}
<hr>
- Tables have historically been considered a weaker point in R.

- There are several packages that have been developed to address this issue:

  - [knitr::kable](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/knitr.pdf#page=29.08) (very basic)
  - [{kableExtra}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html)
  - [{flextable}](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/) (more advanced, ideal for Word)
  - [{stargazer}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/stargazer.pdf) (works directly with regression models)
  - [{gt}](https://gt.rstudio.com/) (a newer package we'll focus on today)

## Preparing to Make a Table{.smaller}
<hr>
- Wrangle your data into the data you want to show up in your table:
  - e.g., If you want summaries, `summarize()`
  - e.g., If you only want certain columns, `filter()`
  - If you have specific row names, make sure there is a variable for them
- That is, when you print the tibble or data frame, it should generally look like you want it to look in the table

## Intro to {gt}{.smaller}
<hr>
- {gt} is a package that makes it easy to create tables in R
- It is designed to be easy to use and to produce beautiful tables
- It is also designed to be easy to customize
- Was developed by the RStudio team
- Let's have a [preview of what it can do]()
